# React Chat Website

A real-time chat application built using modern web technologies. The backend server will be built with Node.js and Express, while the frontend will be developed using React, Vite, TypeScript, and Material-UI. I'll be using PostgreSQL as our database and Prisma as our ORM for seamless database interactions.

## Features

- Real-time messaging using Socket.IO
- CRUD operations for managing chat messages
